# Brick_Breaker (Destructor)

The game Destructor is very similar to the arcade game called as "Brick Breaker". It is a single player game, and the main purpose of the player in the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen before the player loses all the pads(lives). The game is divided into two game parts i.e. campaign mode and the level mode. If the player selects the "Start Game" option, the player will automatically enter the campaign mode, where the player would play all the level or would continue to level up until he dies or there are no more level for the player to test on. The game is a 10 level game. Besides the game mode, there is also user mode i.e. player mode and the god mode. The player mode restricts the player from using cheat codes, while in the god mode, the player gets complete freedom to add extra pads, change the type of the ball, add multiple balls on the screen and so on. To know more about the game, play the game and explore it by yourself.
